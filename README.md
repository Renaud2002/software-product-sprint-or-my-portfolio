# Google Software Product Sprint



This repo contains Renaud Noubieptie's portfolio and SPS projects.

## Summary 

This webpage is contians some basic information about me, my grade, school, major and etc.

I built as part of the Google SPS program this is intended for anyone out there to get to know me and what I am up to.

This site was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java.

## Cool things

The webpage has a translate feature where the home page can be translated to a select langauge. This was made to make the webpage more accessible to more people.

It has a cool feature where you can write your name and it will be displayed back to you accompanied with a hello.The site also contains a cookie meant to record the visitor language prefrence, so when the visitor returns the site will automatically display the text in their language.

There also is a buttom that when click will say hello in different langauges. And an other one that will display some radom facts about me.

This features where possible using JavaScript and JavaServlet.
