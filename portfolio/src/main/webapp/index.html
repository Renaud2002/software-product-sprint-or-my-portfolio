            Hi, my name is Renaud Fred Noubieptie kamgang. You can call me Fred. I am a student  studying <br/>
            computer science at the George Washington University. My family and I moved to the U.S. in june of 2017. <br/>
            I was fortunate enough to come here at the age of high school. So, I went through all my 4 years of high school in the U.S. <br/>
            Since then I have embarked on an adventure to follow my dreams  and my goals for the future. <br/>
            All that I have done to this day would have not been possible if not for Kimberly and Brad Barron and my mom.<br/>
